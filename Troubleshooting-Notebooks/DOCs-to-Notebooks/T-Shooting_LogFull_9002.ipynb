                "There is a difference between truncating a transaction log and shrinking a transaction log. Log Truncation occurs normally during a transaction log backup, and is a logical operation which removes committed records inside the log, whereas log shrinking reclaims physical space on the file system by reducing the file size. Log truncation occurs on a virtual-log-file (VLF) boundary, and a log file may contain many VLFs. A log file can be shrunk only if there is empty space inside the log file to reclaim. Shrinking a log file alone cannot solve the problem of a full log file, instead, you must discover why the log file is full and cannot be truncated.\n",
