It’s expected\n","that the user generates and signs the certificates for the following\n","endpoints: Management Proxy, Gateway, App-Proxy, Master and Controller.\n","Please refer to individual certificate sections below to check the\n","certificate requirements imposed by the notebook. Note that for each pod\n","in master pool in a HA environment we require a different certificate.\n","Certificates will be read from the paths specified in the `Parameters`\n","cell below. This notebook performs the following steps below:\n","\n","1.  Upload and install external root CA used for signing the\n","    certificates.\n","2.  Upload generated endpoint certificate to controller pod.\n","3.  Validate and install each endpoint certificate into the Big Data\n","    Cluster.\n","\n","All certificates will be stored temporarily in the controller pod (at\n","the `controller_cert_store_root` location).\n","\n","Please note that it can take up to 30 minutes for the notebook to be\n","executed.\n","\n","Upon completion of this notebook, https:// access to the Big Data\n","Cluster endpoints from any machine that installs the external CA will\n","show as being secure.\n","\n","### Parameters\n","\n","The parameters set here will override the default parameters set in each\n","individual notebook (`azdata notebook run` injects a `Parameters` cell\n","at runtime with the values passed in from the `-a` argument). Values of\n","these parameters can be modified to point to the paths where\n","user-generated certificates are located.
